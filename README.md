I'm a junior front-end developer with a passion for creating beautiful, responsive, and user-friendly websites. My main areas of expertise are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, and I'm always eager to learn more.

I believe that good design is as important as good code, and I always strive to create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces. I'm also a strong believer in accessibility and web standards, and I make sure my code is optimized for search engines and assistive technologies.



Feel free to check out some of my recent projects and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate! ðŸš€

Skills: HTML5 / CSS / SASS / Bootstrap / Tailwind / JavaScript / React
